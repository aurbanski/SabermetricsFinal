## Explanation of Statistic
### How Our Statistic is Calculated
*Spd<sub>year+1</sub> = .1(Spd<sub>year-2</sub>)+.3(Spd<sub>year-1</sub>)+.6(Spd<sub>year</sub>)*

*OPS<sub>year+1</sub> = .1(OPS<sub>year-2</sub>)+.3(OPS<sub>year-1</sub>)+.6(OPS<sub>year</sub>)*

*wRC+<sub>year+1</sub> = .1(wRC+<sub>year-2</sub>)+.3(wRC+<sub>year-1</sub>)+.6(wRC+<sub>year</sub>)*

*UvC = (wRC+<sub>year+1</sub> + OPS<sub>year+1</sub> + Spd<sub>year+1</sub>)/Current Age*


### Why Is This a Good Statistic?
I think this is a good statistic because it takes in multiple years of data where most other statistics don’t. Most other statistics are just a year-by-year representation of how a player is currently doing, but our statistic is able to represent multiple years of trends in a players play. In this way, it’s a lot different than other statistics since it might do a better job of predicting a players performance. The statistic is really doing something different than most other statistics. It takes into account multiple well-rounded statistics in its calculation so that also helps. 


This statistic can be used to look into the future on how players are going to be in the near and long term future. Commonly in baseball, it takes a few years for players to be good consistently. This statistic ensures that a player has had more than just one potential ‘fluke’ good season. It is also one of the few statistics that incorporates a players age into how good they will potentially be. Ignoring baseball players natural athletic decline is something that should not be done. 

### What Statistics is it Most Related To?
This statistic is calculated using other statistics so it’s gonna be closely related to all of the statistics that we used. It’s related to wRC+, OPS, Spd, and Age. If I had to choose one statistic that it’s most similar to though, it would probably be Spd. We wanted to base our statistic on Bill James research and his player Spd statistic. Like James, our statistic tries to identify trends and gauge player decline. 

### How Is It Different From Other Statistics?
As mentioned before, a lot of other statistics don’t take into account multiple years of statistics. They only work for a single year or a career. Our statistic leverages a three-year window comparatively. 


Our statistic also aims to predict a trend in a player’s career. A lot of the other statistics are just representations of how a player performed, but ours tries to actually give representation to how a player might perform in the future.
